# AirGradient ESPHome Configurations

ESPHome yaml files for AirGradient devices to maintain the research and accuracy of AirGradient sensors, while also gaining the benefits of ESPHome/HomeAssistant for easy to use switches, buttons, configurations, and dashboards.  Maintains the ability to also send data to the AirGradient Dashboard, which can also be disabled/removed to keep all data local.

## Breaking Changes

* Remove substitution line such as `config_version: 2.0.5` from the main file, as this has been moved into the board package file
* Updated to 4.0.0 versions, skipping 3.x to avoid confusion with current AirGradient official firmware
* Now defaulting to https for AirGradient API communication.  If older devices (DIY and Pro models) go into constant reboots, switch to the api package `airgradient_api_d1_mini_insecure.yaml` to revert to the original communication method

## Changes

* Support for ESPHome 2024.6 and later
* Added extended timeout for API upload on ONE and OpenAir models to reduce reboots
* Applied correction algorithms for PM2.5 provided by AirGradient
  * https://www.airgradient.com/documentation/correction-algorithms/
* Updated API upload to follow current structure including both raw and corrected values
* Moved config_version substitution into the board package so it can be updated without manual change to main config file.  Please remove the line starting with `config_version:` from your personal files
* Split captive portal config to a separate package.  Can be removed if not using the portal or if defining wifi networks in your config file, which results in a small memory savings
* Removed safe_mode package by default.  Very few use cases for it
* Added commented out packages for extended_life configs to make it easier to enable if desired
* Added commented out package for SHT30 temp sensor in AG Pro file to make it easier to switch to if desired
* Added new sensor options for raw values for PM2.5, temp, and humidity in some device configurations, and added AirGradient provided correction algorithms to the standard sensors
* AG DIY Basic display config changed to same font as other models, downloading from gfonts instead of using local file

## Features

Many added features can be found in HomeAssistant by going to Settings>Devices and selecting the AirGradient device.  Alternatively, add `web_server:` to the config file to enable a built-in web server on the AirGradient device (No recommended for devices based on the D1 Mini ESP8266)

- Compact single page display by default with all relevant sensor readings
- Display Contrast slider to dim the display
- Enable different pages of information to be shown on the OLED display, or leave the default of a single page with all relevant information

  - Long press (More than 1 second, less than 5) - Trigger manual CO2 calibration
- Leverage automation in HomeAssistant to turn on the "Blank" page and turn off all other pages to effectively disable the display output.  Could also turn off the LED strip or set Brightness to 0 to eliminate output while still collecting sensor data

## Installation

### Standard

* In ESPHome web interface, click New Device.  Give any name. Select any model of board, and click Skip on the final page to not install at this time. Click Edit on the new entry and replace with the contents of the .yaml file for your model.
* Alternatively, copy the .yaml file from the main folder for your model in this repo and place it in the `config` folder of your ESPHome.
* Make any desired changes to the substitutions to name the devices for your use case
* Install to the device using one of the ESPHome options.

> Note: by default ESPHome only syncs remote repositories that the packages are referencing once per day, so if changes are made to the repository, you may not get the updated config for up to 1 day after it is published.  You can remove the contents of the folder config/.esphome/packages to force it to update sooner

> Note: setting `add_mac_suffix: "true"` allows for multiple devices on your network at the same time and report as unique entries even if your `name:` field is duplicated, but it can cause ESPHome to not detect devices as Online after installing, since ESPHome is looking for only the `name:` field and the actual device name has the MAC address added to the end
>
> One way to resolve this is to change `add_mac_suffix: "false"` so the device name will match exactly.  If you have multiple devices, make sure to change the `name: `field to be unique for each device
>
> Another alternative is to add a static IP to the wifi configuration and configure ESPHome to ping the device by IP instead of hostname

> Example for static IP
>
> ```yaml
> wifi:
>   ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
>   password: !secret wifi_password
>   manual_ip:
>     static_ip: 192.168.1.121
>     gateway: 192.168.1.1
>     subnet: 255.255.255.0
>     dns1: 192.168.1.1
> ```

### ESPHome Web install

Install a compiled file to your device all with just a browser and USB cable, no ESPHome install required.

Save the appropriate .bin file and go to [https://web.esphome.io/](https://web.esphome.io/) in your browser to connect your ESP device and send the .bin file to it

> In some cases, the device may encounter errors using the web flash tool.  Steps to put the device in a special boot flash mode can be found here:
> [https://forum.airgradient.com/t/airgradient-one-not-working-after-flashing-with-arduino/1326/4 ](https://forum.airgradient.com/t/airgradient-one-not-working-after-flashing-with-arduino/1326/4)

### Full YAML file

The `full_config` folder contains a single yaml file per model that contains the full standalone configuration, created by the `esphome config` command.  This adds in all of the optional parameters, so is much longer than the minimum configuration, but the single file contains all needed information to be completely independent from this repo.

Copy the full config file to your personal ESPhome config file and customize as desired, then install to your device.

## Troubleshooting

If some sensors are not showing valid readings after installing or upgrading, please remove the power cable from the device entirely for 5-10 seconds, then reconnect.  Many issues are resolved with a full power reset, as the software reset does not fully clear some situations.

## Configuration

If all original sensors (PMS5003, Senseair S8, SHT4x) are connected, configuration files should be ready for use.

If some sensors are not installed, comment or remove the associated sections under `packages:`

The PMS5003 sensor by default collects readings every second.  Since this device has a limited lifespan, it is possible to extend the life by collecting readings less frequently, although this could impact the accuracy of the readings collected, since there will not be constant airflow through the device when the fan shuts down.  To collect readings every 2 minutes, change the line for the pms5003 sensor to `sensor_pms5003_extended_life.yaml`

> See [PMSX003 Particulate Matter Sensor — ESPHome](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/pmsx003.html#sensor-longevity) for more information

To add your WiFi SSID and password, add your SSID and password information, per ESPHome specifications

```yaml
wifi:
  ssid: NachoWiFi
  password: 123456123456
```

## Modification

#### Using local packages

By default, packages are referencing this GitHub repository, allowing you to do a new Install from ESPHome dashboard to get the latest modifications without downloading other files, but does require an Internet connection.  If you wish to have more control over modifications or only reference local files, copy the `packages` folder to your local ESPHome folder in a `packages` subfolder and replace `github://MallocArray/airgradient_esphome/packages `with `!include packages`

```yaml
# Example
board: github://MallocArray/airgradient_esphome/packages/sensor_s8.yaml
# becomes
board: !include packages/sensor_s8.yaml
```

#### Using Extend feature

Rather than download an individual package and update the reference to it, you may also use the [Extend](https://esphome.io/guides/configuration-types.html#extend) option to make minor modifications without editing the packages file.  This only works for items with and `id:` defined

> Example: adding this to the main file for your device will change the pin number in the config_button package, while maintaining all other settings defined in the package
>
> ```
> binary_sensor:
>   - id: !extend config_button
>     pin:
>       number: D7
> ```

#### Copy and Paste

It is also possible to copy the contents of a package file and paste it directly into your YAML file.  Do note that sections cannot be duplicated, so if multiple sections like `interval` are pasted in, they must be combined into a single entry when using this method.

#### Adding other packages

Several additional packages are available in the `packages` folder that can be added or removed as needed.  See the [Packages page](/packages.md) for more information about available options.

## Additional Information

MQTT support has been mentioned in the AirGradient forums several times.  ESPHome supports this by adding a few lines to the main yaml file. Add the relevant information for your configuration. Read more about it here:

## Todo list

Several more features are planned to be added to this repo

- [ ] Explore options for disabling display/LED during certain times (May be differed to HomeAssistant Automation)
- [X] Standardize font on AirGradient Basic display to match Pro
