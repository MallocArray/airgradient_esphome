# AirGradient ESPHome Configurations

ESPHome yaml files for AirGradient devices to maintain the research and accuracy of AirGradient sensors, while also gaining the benefits of ESPHome/HomeAssistant for easy to use switches, buttons, configurations, and dashboards.  Maintains the ability to also send data to the AirGradient Dashboard, which can also be disabled/removed to keep all data local.

## Breaking Changes

* 5.0.0 is a major version upgrade as switching to esp-idf is not fully supported via OTA. Highly recommend doing one USB flash of 5.0.0 and later to the AirGradient ONE and OpenAir devices to reformat the storage to support esp-idf.  Future updates can be done Over-The-Air without issue.
  * If not done, the device is likely to reboot at some point and switch to the standby partition, returning to a version prior to 5.0.0

  * [Read/Write bootloader, partition table and any partition via OTA by angelnu · Pull Request #5535 · esphome/esphome](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/5535)
* Aware of errors in the logs stating `esp_task_wdt_reconfigure(615): Invalid arguments`
  * Tracking [Watchdog config hardcoded core mask · Issue #6767 · esphome/issues](https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/6767)
* 5.0.0 switches ONE and OpenAir models (based on ESP32) to the esp-idf framework, freeing up some memory and allowing other advanced features such as bluetooth_proxy and esp32_improv.  If the previous Arduino framework is desired, change the board to `airgradient_esp32-c3_board-arduino.yaml`
* If attempting to add BT and BLE support, may need to remove the captive_portal package to free up enough space [Issue #115](https://github.com/MallocArray/airgradient_esphome/issues/115)

## Changes

* Added optional package for using LED bar on AirGradient ONE to reflect TVOC values
* Added examples of Home Assistant automation to disable the display and LED at a scheduled time in configuration.md

## Features

Many added features can be found in HomeAssistant by going to Settings>Devices and selecting the AirGradient device.  Alternatively, add `web_server:` to the config file to enable a built-in web server on the AirGradient device (Not recommended for devices based on the D1 Mini ESP8266)

- Compact single page display by default with all relevant sensor readings
- Display Contrast slider to dim the display
- Enable different pages of information to be shown on the OLED display, or leave the default of a single page with all relevant information

  ![1703765819874](image/README/1703765819874.png)
- Button to initiate a SenseAir S8 CO2 Calibration on demand

  ![1703765340274](image/README/1703765340274.png)
- Switch to enable or disable SenseAir S8 CO2 sensor Automatic Baseline Calibration (ABC)

  ![1704131891282](image/README/1704131891282.png)
- Button to view the current S8 ABC interval (confirm if ABC is disabled or enable, which defaults to every 7 days) View ESPHome logs to see the output of this button

  ![1703765530959](image/README/1703765530959.png)
- Switch to disable LED output on AirGradient ONE model
- Brightness slider to adjust intensity of AirGradient ONE LED

  ![1703765585475](image/README/1703765585475.png)
- Switch to toggle display between Fahrenheit and Celsius and persist between reboots

  ![1703765618154](image/README/1703765618154.png)
- Switch to enable or disable uploading to AirGradient Dashboard via API (Choose to keep data local or also send to AirGradient)

  ![1703765631637](image/README/1703765631637.png)
- Utilize hardware configuration buttons on AirGradient Pro v3.7 and higher

  - Short press (Less than 1 second) - Toggle between F and C on display
  - Long press (More than 1 second, less than 5) - Trigger manual CO2 calibration
- Leverage automation in HomeAssistant to turn on the "Blank" page and turn off all other pages to effectively disable the display output.  Could also turn off the LED strip or set Brightness to 0 to eliminate output while still collecting sensor data
